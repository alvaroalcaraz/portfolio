            <p><h2>Some history</p></h2>
                <p>It was 2009 and I was living in Cádiz, where I was born and raise, since always and my mum decided to move to Barcelona. 
                    At that moment my life was broken and I was lost. I didn't know how important how that will change my life completely.</p>
                <p>10 years after I was already being living not only in Barcelona but London, United Kindom, Strasbourg, France and Charleroi, Belgium 
                    and I decided to study UX/UI Design, I already had a lot of experience in Tourism and Customer service and that
                    help me empathize more with the users and make make work harder to make their lives easier.</p>
